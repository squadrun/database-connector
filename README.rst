Database Connector
========================

A python package that provides database connection to Bifrost database and Substrate database.

Modules
#########

There are three modules - **bifrost** and **substrate**.

All the modules provide the ``engine`` for their respective database.

bifrost
********

This module provides the database connection for the Bifrost database. It provides **read-only** access to the database.


substrate
**********

This module provides the database connection for the Substrate database. It provides **read-only** access to the database.

Usage
------

.. code-block:: python

    from database_connector import bifrost, substrate

    bifrost_engine = bifrost.engine
    substrate_engine = substrate.engine

    # Database connection is automatically closed when connection is used in a context manager i.e. inside "with"
    with bifrost_engine.connect() as conn:
        data = conn.execute("Select * from customer")

        # data is a dictionary with column name as key and row as value
        for row in data:
            print(row)
            
    # Database connection is automatically closed when connection is used in a context manager i.e. inside "with"
    with substrate_engine.connect() as conn:
        data = conn.execute("Select * from customer")

        # data is a dictionary with column name as key and row as value
        for row in data:
            print(row)
